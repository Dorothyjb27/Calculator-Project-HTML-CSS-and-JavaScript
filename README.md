# Calculator-Project-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript


I built this calculator as a small practice project while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I followed a YouTube tutorial for the basic structure, but I customized the design with my own colors, styles, and layout.

I also added a fun extra feature — an “Oops” button — which was my favorite part to implement!

I’m still learning, so I would love any feedback or suggestions on how to improve the code, design, or functionality.
